# demonstration-site
HTML and CSS for DIG UXD Fellowship application. All pages created by Jessamine Bartley-Matthews, September 2015.

Files include:
* index.html: This is the homepage of the demonstration site, which will load automatically.
* login.html: The button on the homepage (index.html) links to this page, which prompts users to enter their username and password.
* css/style_sheet.css: A separate folder containing the page's styling. This is where you will edit all fonts, colors, and styles.

Notes:
This page was created using absolute styles, as this is what I have learned at this point. With guidance from a more experienced developer, or a bit more exploration into responsive website creation, I could fix it further. I have kept the design clean and minimal to adhere to project specifications, but images and navigation bars could easily be added within the current framework to allow for advanced customization.
